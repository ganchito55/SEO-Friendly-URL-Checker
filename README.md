SEO-Friendly-URL-Checker
========================

When this software you can check if all files that you are going to use in your website are SEO friendly.
A URL is SEO friendly if it only have lower case letter a-z and we use - for split the words

How to build:

$ git clone https://github.com/ganchito55/SEO-Friendly-URL-Checker.git

$ make

How to run: (I recommend build it):

You can download the software in bin folder. There are two files, seoFriendly run in Ubuntu 64 bits. Only if you use a 64 bits Operative System and you can't run seoFriendly you should try seoFriendlyStatic because it doesn't use dynamic libraries.

How to use:

$ ./seoFriendly path

for example:
$ ./seoFriendly /var/www/website

I'll try to upload some screenshot, now I can't do a screenshot with Elementary OS and last AMD driver :(
